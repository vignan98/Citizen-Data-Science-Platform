  * As a Software Engineer at **Ericsson India Global Services** I worked on Complete configuration and Environmental set up of a complex, automated Data Science Application called **DATAIKU** which was onboared under the name **Citizen Data Science Platform**.
  * The three instances of the application POC, Sandbox, Production were configured and entire environmental set up was designed and orchestrated on Microsoft Azure & Linux.
  * Understanding the application and its design, Configuring Azure VMs, onboarding new features were the primary tasks involved during the installation process
  * This Application requires knowledge of Data Science, Machine Learning to understand different workflows that were developed to automate the steps in Machine Learning

## USE CASE & MY WORK üñ•Ô∏è   
  * Different business teams like Supply, Sourcing, Innovation have their Data in different database instances. The primary goal of these business teams is to analyse their data efficiently & Develop a Machine Learning model that would be used for future predictions. 
  * As a part of Application Owners team our duties include understanding the use case,suggesting further steps in onboarding the data from postgresql/Mysql databases & supporting the business teams from Data Cleaning to Model deployment stage.
  * Documentation of the entire installation process was carried out to track the progress and install the same application on other instances.
  
## APPLICATION IN PRODUCTION
  * Different Security questions regarding Data, visibility of the Data, leakage of data from databases, User controls, admin controls were brainstormed and handled effectively.
  * Once the application was pushed to production, users were onboarded to work on different use case projects. The issues related to server Management, log Management, Memory Management were handled efficiently & quickly.
  * The repeated tasks related to Log management, Disk management were automated using bash scripting.
  * Integration of the application with new tools (ex: Tableau) was made after co-ordinating with the vendor team(Dataiku).
